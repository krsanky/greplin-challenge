Level 2

----------------------------------------

Congratulations.  You have reached level 2.

To get the password for level 3, write code to find the first prime
fibonacci number larger than a given minimum.  For example, the first
prime fibonacci number larger than 10 is 13.

When you are ready, go here or call this automated
number (415) 799-9454.

You will receive additional instructions at that time.  For the second portion
of this task, note that for the number 12 we consider the sum of the prime divisors
to be 2 + 3 = 5.  We do not include 2 twice even though it divides 12 twice.


---- next-part:
Step 1. Use your code to compute the smallest prime fibonacci number
	greater than 227,000.  Call this number X.

Step 2. The password for level 3 is the sum of prime divisors of (X + 1).
                                                               (parens i added)

Note: If you call the number instead, it will check your answer for step 1.
